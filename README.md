This is my first project on TheodinProject course.

In this project I made a main page which titles as Odin Recipes and has a list of recipes.
From the main page any recipe can be selected and the corresponding page for the recipe will open.
Each recipe page contains Image of the finished dish, description of the dish, ingredients and the instructions.

Hope you will like it.
Enjoy!
