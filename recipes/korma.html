    <h2>WHAT IS Chicken Korma, AND WHY DO I LOVE IT SO MUCH?</h2>
    <p>Chicken korma is a rich and flavorful curry bathed in a creamy, aromatic sauce. Tender pieces of chicken, marinated in yogurt and spices, are <br>
        simmered in a gravy fragrant with ginger, garlic, and warm spices like coriander and cardamom. The luxurious sauce gets its unique <br>
        creaminess from yogurt or heavy cream, while nuts like almonds or cashews sometimes add a touch of richness and texture. Unlike many<br>
         curries, kormas are known for their mild spice level, allowing the depth of flavor from the slow-cooked aromatics and yogurt to shine through.<br>
          It's a decadent dish fit for a special occasion, perfect for spooning over rice or dipping in fluffy naan bread.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients Required</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken (1 kg / 2.2 lbs) - bone-in or boneless, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>Yogurt (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Ginger-garlic paste (2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Whole spices: bay leaf (1), cloves (3), cardamom pods (3)</li>
        <li>Onion (1, large, sliced)</li>
        <li>Ground spices: coriander powder (1 tablespoon), turmeric powder (1 teaspoon), garam masala (1 teaspoon), red chili powder (1/2 <br>
            teaspoon, adjust for spice)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water or chicken broth (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Heavy cream (1/2 cup, optional) - for a richer gravy</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro (chopped, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong>  In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, green chilies (if using), and salt. Add the <br>
            chicken pieces and toss to coat them evenly. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight <br>
            for deeper flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat oil and temper spices:</strong>  Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the bay leaf, cloves, and cardamom pods. Let<br>
             them sizzle for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Saut√© the onions:</strong>Add the sliced onions and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add ground spices:</strong>Stir in the coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and red chili powder. Cook for another minute, stirring <br>
            constantly, to release the aromas of the spices.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the marinated chicken:</strong>Add the marinated chicken along with any leftover marinade in the bowl. Increase the heat to <br>
            medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned on all sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer with liquid:</strong>Pour in the water or chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 20-25 <br>
            minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and serve:</strong>Turn off the heat and garnish your chicken korma with chopped fresh cilantro. Serve hot with rice, naan bread, or roti.</li>
    </ol>
