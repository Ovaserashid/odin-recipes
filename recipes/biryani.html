    <h2>WHAT IS BIRYANI, AND WHY DO I LOVE IT SO MUCH?</h2>
    <p>Essentially, it’s your favourite chicken curry (or vegetable or other protein of choice) buried under a mound of delicately spiced fluffy rice, all<br>
       made in one pot. The rice is steamed over a low heat so it absorbs the flavours of the curry bubbling away underneath.</p>
    <p>So in a nutshell, it’s every curry loving-carb monsters’ dream come true. It’s got my name written all over it!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients Required</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken (1.1 lbs)</li>
        <li>Basmati rice (2 cups)</li>
        <li>Yogurt (3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Ginger-garlic paste (1¼ tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Green chili (optional)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Spices: biryani masala, turmeric powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, coriander powder, roasted cumin powder, salt</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs: mint leaves, coriander leaves</li>
        <li>Onion (sliced)</li>
        <li>Saffron strands (pinch)</li>
        <li>Milk (2 tablespoons)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong>  Wash and cut the chicken into pieces. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, green chili, <br>
            oil, spices (biryani masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, salt), and chopped mint and coriander leaves.<br>
            Mix well, coating the chicken evenly. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator for deeper flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the rice:</strong>  Rinse the basmati rice in water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in clean water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the onions:</strong>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Sauté the sliced onions until golden brown. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon <br>
            and set them aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the marinated chicken:</strong>In the same pot with the remaining oil, add the marinated chicken. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,<br>
             until the chicken is browned on all sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the biryani:</strong>Add a layer of cooked chicken to the bottom of the pot. Sprinkle with some fried onions and a few strands of saffron <br>
            (soaked in milk). Now, add half of the drained rice. Season with salt and more saffron milk. Repeat the layering process with the remaining <br>
            chicken, fried onions, rice, and saffron milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal the pot:</strong>Here's a traditional touch: make a dough using flour and water. Seal the rim of the pot with this dough to trap the steam and <br>
            aromas. Alternatively, you can use aluminum foil to cover the pot tightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the biryani:</strong>Bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Then, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30-35 minutes, or until the rice is cooked<br>
             through.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong>Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10-15 minutes with the lid on. This allows the flavors to develop further. Fluff<br>
             the rice gently with a fork before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken biryani!</li>
