    <h2>WHAT IS Chicken Fried Rice, AND WHY DO I LOVE IT SO MUCH?</h2>
    <p>Chicken fried rice is a classic Asian-inspired dish made with cooked rice, stir-fried vegetables, eggs, and diced chicken. It's a quick and easy <br>meal that's 
        perfect for using up leftover rice. The key to good chicken fried rice is using cold, cooked rice to prevent mushiness and cooking <br>everything over high heat 
        for a slightly charred flavor.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients Required</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked, cold rice (2 cups) - Preferably day-old, not freshly cooked</li>
        <li>Chicken ( boneless, skinless breasts or thighs - 1/2 lb)</li>
        <li>Eggs (2 large)</li>
        <li>Chopped onion</li>
        <li>Diced carrots</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Sesame oil (1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped scallions (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Oyster sauce (1 tablespoon, optional) - adds umami depth</li>
        <li>Light soy sauce (1 tablespoon, optional) - for a richer flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the ingredients:</strong>  Cook your rice according to package instructions and let it cool completely in the refrigerator for at least a few <br>
            hours, or overnight (preferably). This prevents mushy rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong>  Dice or shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Heat a wok or large skillet over medium heat with 1 tablespoon <br>
            vegetable oil. Add the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the <br>
            pan and set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Scramble the eggs: </strong>Whisk the eggs in a small bowl. Add a teaspoon of oil to the wok (or pan) used to cook the chicken. Increase the <br>
            heat to medium-high. Pour in the whisked eggs and scramble them until cooked through but still slightly soft, about 1 minute. Push the cooked eggs to <br>
            the side of the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir-fry the vegetables: </strong>Add another teaspoon of oil to the pan. Add the chopped onion and diced carrots and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes,<br>
            or until the onions are softened. If using frozen peas, add them at this point and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and season:</strong>Push the vegetables to one side of the pan. Add the cooked rice to the empty side of the pan and break it up with a<br>
             spatula. Once hot, pour in the soy sauce, light soy sauce (if using), and oyster sauce (if using). Stir-fry for a minute to combine everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the protein and final touches: </strong>Add the cooked chicken and scrambled eggs back to the pan and toss everything together to <br>
            combine evenly. Drizzle with sesame oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Garnish with chopped scallions and serve immediately. Enjoy your homemade chicken fried rice!</li>
    </ol>
